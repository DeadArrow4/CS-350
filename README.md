# CS-350
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  This project involved creating a working thermostat using a development board with various integrated peripherals. The main objective was to combine classroom concepts with new information to build the code and functionality necessary for a thermostat. The system reads temperature changes from a sensor on the board, which then triggers an LED to simulate a heater turning on
  
What did you do particularly well?
  I excelled in structuring the code and creating variables that were both logical and purpose-driven. After considerable troubleshooting and experimentation, I was able to develop code that is well-organized and easy to follow.
  
Where could you improve?
  I tend to overthink solutions, which led me to rewrite the program multiple times. I also recognize that I need to improve my understanding of how to code certain peripherals more efficiently.
  
What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
  I found tremendous value in engaging in discussions and asking questions about the project. The insights from peers and the professor helped clarify complex aspects of the assignment.
  
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
  This project helped me understand how to integrate different peripherals to create a functional system. Seeing the temperature sensorâ€™s output change in the terminal, along with the corresponding LED response, was a rewarding experience.
  
How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I made the code for this project clean, well-organized, and easy to follow. Detailed comments explain each line of code, the purpose of variables, and overall functionality. The code is logically structured, particularly the while loop, which manages timer checks in a way that is easy to modify.
